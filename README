Native & Cross-Dev Code & Tools for Amigas
==========================================

This is a selection of code that I will add to over time. There are
three main file types, distinguished by suffix:
 .S   :: CPP + GAS assembler syntax (for cross-dev environments)
 .asm :: Amiga native asm syntax (Devpac, AsmOne, PhxAss, vasm, Barfly, ...)
 .c   :: Somewhat-portable C (I will gladly take patches to make the C code
         work outside a GCC/POSIX environment).

All code is public domain (see the COPYING file).

File descriptions follow. For detailed build and usage instructions, see
file header comments and run-time help info:

Makefile/Rules.mk
  GNU Make cross-dev build rules and convenience makefile.

crc16_ccitt.S
  Table-driven CRC16-CCITT implementation.

degzip_{gnu,portable}.c
  Analyse gzip files, extract and write out their raw Deflate streams
  (can then be processed by inflate, see below).
  Original version for GNU/Linux, and portable version fixed by phx / EAB.

inflate.{S,asm}
  Small and efficient implementation of Inflate, as specified
  in RFC 1951 "DEFLATE Compressed Data Format Specification".
