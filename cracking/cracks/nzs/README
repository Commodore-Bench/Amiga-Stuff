The same crack and trainer is shown here in native PhxAss assembler,
and also in syntax suitable for GNU gcc+binutils.

Main changes for the GNU toolchain:

1. Flags are passed to GNU as to avoid needing to prefix register
names with %, keep branches always PC-relative, and to keep addressing
displacements 16-bit.

2. Hex literals are prefixed 0x rather than $.

3. Automatic shortening of BRA, Bcc, and BSR instructions requires use
of pseudo-op names JRA, Jcc, JBSR.

4. Comments are C-style rather than ; to end-of-line.

5. RS.x directives for allocating BSS space do not exist. Fake out an
alternative with CPP plus the .struct directive.

6. Use .ascii and .asciz directives for string literals.

7. Use CPP in place of equ directives

Really not very much, and the assembler is less buggy than PhxAss.
