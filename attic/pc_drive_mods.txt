1. Change DS1 to DS0.
2. Cut pin 2 and pin 34.
3. Connect pin 2 to DSKCHG (old pin 34).
4. Connect pin 34 to RDY.

Finding RDY
============
May be jumpered or marked. If not may need to search for it. It may
not exist at all.

Teac 235HF
----------
Many variants, by part nr suffix:
6291: 80-pin ASIC. ASIC pin 10
7291: 80-pin ASIC. ASIC pin 10
7383: 80-pin ASIC. ASIC pin 10

8291: 56-pin ASIC. No RDY (checked all ASIC pins)

A291: 52-pin ASIC. Pad TP4, ASIC pin 41
                   XXX My test drive is missing RDY,
                   perhaps I got this one wrong XXX

Teac 235HG
----------
C630: 52-pin ASIC (different to 235HF-A291)
      Not fully searched, but no obvious RDY.

NEC FD1231M/FD1231H
-------------------
ASIC is marked FDN305.
No RDY signal (checked all ASIC pins).
This will apply to all drives using the same ASIC.
The documented hack to use TP15 for RDY is not fully correct:
 - it becomes active too quickly after motor on (0-35ms).
 - it temporarily becomes active when removing/inserting disks.
